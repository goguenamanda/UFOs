# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to compile a range of data related to UFO sightings and create a table for users to be able to search for specific information on sightings, based on either date, city, county, state, shape, or all of the above. 

## Results: 
After opening my html file in a large server, the webpage opens with my preferred styling settings. There are default placefiller words in the search filter categories to help users understand the type of searches they would be able to perform. Below is an image of the default screen one would see when they enter my webpage.

On the bottom left-hand side of the screen is the filter section for the table. I've included the default placefiller words which users can overwrite when they are ready to search. I've included the image of the filter search section below.

Finally, I've included an image below showing the filter section in action and how it changes the data in the chart. Users do not have to fill in every field in the filter section, as demonstrated below. I only input one filter which was to look at UFO sightings in the state of Colorado. Users simply have to type in a word or date that they are looking for and press the 'enter' key on their computer for the table to filter.

## Summary: 
One of the major drawbacks of this page is that in the 'date' search column, individuals must have the full date written in the correct format in order to filter the table. For example, if I wanted to filter the table simply by the year '2010', I would be unable to do so. My recommendation would be to create more columns that separate the day, month, and year into separate search criteria, so that users can be more specific in their search without necessarily knowing the exact dates that they are looking for. Another recommendation that I would have is to expand the 'comments' column in the data table. Some of the columns have comments that are cut off after they exceed a certain number of words, which means users are unable to read the full comments related to the UFO sighting event, which may be important to their research.
